### Hi, my name is Andrew Bergan
I'm a Research Engineer at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley), specializing in structural mechanics. I develop [computational models](https://github.com/nasa/CompDam_DGD) to predict when and how carbon/epoxy composite materials fail. My research is supported by the [Advanced Composites Project](https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/programs/aavp/ac), the [Composite Technology for Exploration project](https://gameon.nasa.gov/projects/composite-technology-for-exploration-cte/), and the [Space Launch System Program](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html). I joined NASA Langley in 2013.

My current research interests include progressive damage analysis of composite structures, analysis verification and validation, high-fidelity structural testing, x-ray computed tomography segmentation, high performance computing for finite element analysis, damage tolerance, composite stitching, and bonded joints.

### When I'm not working
I enjoy outdoor adventure sports including sailing, skiing, mountain biking, trail running, and rock climbing. I spend too much tinkering with my house and my cars. I live with my wife in Newport News, VA.

Thanks for reading!
