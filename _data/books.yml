  author: Daniel Kahneman
  finished: April 17, 2018
  amazon: 'https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555'
  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RtytNpsfL.jpg'
  notes: "Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky changed how we think about how we think. They explored dozens of biases and cognitive shortcuts that define how we see (and remember) the world. The implications touch nearly every aspect of life. If you've read about psychology, bias, decision making, or behavioral economics in the last twenty years, chances are some of the ideas you read about trace back to Kahneman and Tversky. This is the book that ties the history of ideas together. What an amazing read - definitely one of my all time favorites!"

  finished: April 6, 2018

  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R17RkflyL.jpg'
  notes: "A fun tour of famous restaurants that left a mark on American history and culture. I found the historical perspective fascinating, though a bit dry and encyclopedic at times. As a millennial, most of the restaurants were new to me. As a food lover, the influence of the restaurateurs, chefs, and menus was fun to learn about. Now, when I go into a restaurant, I can see how the choices of design in atmosphere, service, and menu were influenced by the great eating establishments of the twentieth century. If you are a foodie and you enjoy history, you will love this book."

  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41c15bZNMhL.jpg'
  notes: "This 2017 Pulitzer Prize winner is simply fantastic. Reading this book transports you to the intersection of wealth and poverty in America. The book is an insightful and compelling narrative about the day-to-day realities of poor Americans. This book should be required reading for high school students. As a researcher myself, I'm blown away and inspired by the lengths Desmond went to in order to craft this story - don't skip the prologue, where Desmond describes his investigation and his recommendations."

- title: "The Singal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't"
  author: Nate Silver
  finished: January 31, 2018
  amazon: 'https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087'
  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BNJXrUE6L.jpg'
  notes: "Nate Silver gives the reader a way of thinking probabilistically without getting lost in the math. A good portion of the book discusses Bayes theorem with a strong emphasis on the role of prior beliefs and context in successful predictions. Silver comes back to the fact that many successful predictions rely on a combination of both statistical analysis and expert insight. The book is full of simple explanations that are easy to understand and entertaining examples from everyday life including Silver's analysis of baseball, poker, earth quakes, global warming, and terrorist attacks."

  author: Ashlee Vance
  finished: January 15, 2018
  amazon: 'https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233'
  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5174GQsw2oL.jpg'
  notes: "Vance interviewed over 300 people including Elon's family, friends, and notable employees to create a biography with an investigative flair. The book addresses Elon's success and his failures with equal vigor. While the overall tone often reproduces awe and reverence often found in news articles, Vance also digs into several critiques of the SpaceX and Tesla founder. Vance goes into depth in describing the qualities that separate Elon from other entrepreneurs including his willingness to accept huge risk to realize his vision, his exceptionally high expectations, his incredible memory, and his laser focus. This book is a rare glimpse into one of the most influential people of our time."

  notes: 'A fascinating discussion touching on many of the subtle details of the human mind. Berger follows a natural progression that gives a plain-English explanation of the psychology that underpins everything from why we are likely to name our children after a hurricane to why BMW makes so many different models, options, and colors.'

  cover: 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1354683116l/16158542.jpg'
  notes: 'A riveting account of the 1936 winning crew team from the University of Washington. This is my favorite book from 2017. Brown has managed to tell a fantastically captivating story of triumph in athletics while commenting on American life, the history of rowing, income inequality, the politics of the 1930s, and Nazi Germany. This book was educational, emotional, and hard to put down.'

  cover: 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348899528l/88335.jpg'
  notes: 'A vivid description of logging in the Pacific Northwest is woven into the story of the Golden Spruce, a famous Spruce with golden needles. A logger turned environmentalist cuts the tree down in a deranged act of defiance. Vaillant gives us a perspective into the transformation of natural beauty and tribal life into natural resources harvested with devastating efficiency and the ever-spreading western lifestyle of conspicuous consumption.'

  author: Angela Duckworth
  finished: November, 2017

  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eNdezUTkL.jpg'
  notes: "Angela Duckworth unlocks the secrets of perseverance. She shows how grit separates the highest achievers from the rest. By describing the role grit played in her own journey, Duckworth adds a personal touch that gives the reader a sense of connection to her. My favorite take-away is the hard-thing rule: in Duckworth's family, everyone has to do at least one hard thing, you have to finish what you start, and no one gets to pick the hard rule for anyone else."

  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qHhB6tF9L.jpg'
  notes: "Geithner's account of the Great Recession is an interesting read, but a bit dry. Geithner describes his efforts to maintain liquidity and contends that the crisis could have been much worse. The bottom line is that a systematic underestimation of risk lead to hugely overvalued assets."

  cover: 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kBHEx6xtL.jpg'
  notes: "A compilation of Junger's experiences living in and writing about dangerous situations throughout his career. The book includes one account after another of death, war, and destruction, which made it hard to read. However, one passage resonated with me: '...as life has becoming staggeringly easy, it has also become vaguely unfulfilling' and then continues 'it should be pointed out that people whose lives are inherently dangerous, like coal miners or steel workers, rarely seek adventure. Like most things, danger ceases to be interesting as soon as you have no choice in the matter. For rest of us, threats to our safety and comfort have been so completely wiped out that we have to go out of our way to create them.'"
